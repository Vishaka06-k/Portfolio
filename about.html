                    <h3>Hello, I'm Vishaka!</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a final-year student pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at Sri Krishna College of Technology in Coimbatore. 
                        I have a strong passion for Automation and Robotics, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and innovations in this field.

                    <p>
                        I completed my schooling at St. Maryâ€™s Girls Higher Secondary School in Devakottai, Sivaganga, where I achieved an impressive score of 90%. My interest in technology grew during my schooling years, and I have always been fascinated by how machines can be automated to perform tasks efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from my academic interests, I love to work on **hands-on projects** involving microcontrollers, automation systems, and robotics. My goal is to pursue a career that allows me to develop innovative solutions in the field of automation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, working on personal projects, and experimenting with robotics kits. I am also a firm believer in continuous learning, and I regularly take online courses to stay up to date with the latest advancements in my field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am excited about the future and the opportunities to apply my skills to create real-world solutions. I look forward to collaborating on exciting projects and contributing to the growth of the tech community.
